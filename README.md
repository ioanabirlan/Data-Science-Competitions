# WiDS Datathon++ 2024: Predicting Time to Treatment for Metastatic TNBC


This repository contains our team's solution to the 2024 **WiDS Datathon++** challenge, where we developed multiple machine learning models to predict the time to treatment for women diagnosed with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). 
The goal of this challenge is to address disparities in healthcare access by predicting the number of days it takes for a patient to receive their first treatment based on their demographic and medical data.


The notebook contains multiple solutions and alternative paths to solving the given problem.

## Problem Overview

Metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer, and timely treatment is crucial for patients' survival. The dataset provided for this challenge includes demographic information, diagnostic data, treatment options, and insurance details. Our task was to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the number of days between diagnosis and first treatment.
